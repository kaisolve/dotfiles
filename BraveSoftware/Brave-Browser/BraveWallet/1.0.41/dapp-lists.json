Why is Raydium different?</p>\n<p>Other AMM DEXs and DeFi protocols are only able to access liquidity within their own pools and have no access to a central order book. Additionally, with the majority of platforms running on Ethereum, transactions are slow and gas fees are high.</p>\n<p>Raydium offers a few key advantages:</p>\n<p>1.</p>\n<p>Faster and cheaper: We leverage the efficiency of the Solana blockchain to achieve transactions magnitudes faster than Ethereum and gas fees which are a fraction of the cost.</p>\n<p>2.</p>\n<p>A central order book for ecosystem-wide liquidity: Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to the central limit order book of the Serum DEX, meaning that Raydium allows access to the order flow and liquidity of the entire Serum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>3.</p>\n<p>Trading interface: For traders who want to be able to view TradingView charts, set limit orders and have more control over their trading.</p>",

        "description": "Cykura is a concentrated liquidity market maker platform that allows liquidity providers to choose the price range at which their liquidity is active.",
        "fullDescription": "<p><strong>Cykura</strong> is a market maker platform that allows liquidity providers to choose the price range where their liquidity is active. This is referred to as \"concentrated liquidity\", because assets are placed by the LP at selectedd price intervals, rather than inefficiently dispersed across a 0 to ∞ price curve. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Concentrated liquidity </strong>allows users to designate a price range in which they are willing to make markets, reaping the same market making rewards with only a fraction of the previously required capital. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why Concentrated Liquidity? &nbsp;Good question! Typical AMMs only utilize the liquidity closest to the current trading price of a given asset pair in order to execute trades. This leaves a large share of liquidity providers' assets spread thinly across a wide price range which go unutilized. The practical outcome in such case is that LPs earn nothing on these assets, and traders do not benefit from the idle liquidity which could be used to match their orders. Concentrated Liquidity provides a solution for putting 100% of these idle assets to work. LPs can now place 100% of their assets to work making markets precisely at the price range they think will be most beneficial for earning fees. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what happens if the price of a given asset pair goes out of range and there is no liquidity?</p>\n<p>On Cykura, LPs earn fees in proportion to the share of the liquidity they control. Therefore, LPs have a strong incentive to actively manage where exactly their assets lie along the price curve, in order to maximize opportunities for earning. There is an incentive to shift assets to underserved portions of the pool, as this presents an opportunity to capture a much higher share of pool fees for the LP. Since Cykura is built on Solana, the gas costs associated with actively managing your liquidity position are negligible.</p>",

On CowSwap, you don’t have to worry about finding the best price, optimizing your gas costs, or getting exploited by bots. We take care of everything for you.</p>\n<p>Avoid all the complexities of crypto networks. If the best price is on Uniswap, you get that same price on CowSwap. If there’s a better price elsewhere, CowSwap gives you that price. CowSwap’s gas fees are also lower on average. In addition, CowSwap protects you from getting rekt in ways that other exchanges don’t. On CowSwap, you will never pay for a failed trade. Your trade will never be sandwiched or frontrun. And you don’t have to make sure you hold enough ETH to execute your trade.</p>\n<p>Unlike in other exchanges, users don't execute the trade themselves, but rather place their orders via signed messages. CowSwap handles the execution for you, while you maintain custody of your tokens. After you sign your order, CowSwap tries to match you peer-to-peer with another trader. If there’s a match, you both get better prices and lower fees. For trades that can’t be matched peer-to-peer, we find you the best price on-chain. Why complicate things when you can let the protocol handle everything?</p>\n<p>We check all on-chain liquidity sources (including Uniswap, Sushiswap and others) as well as aggregators like 1inch to pick the best price for you. Even better, if your trade is matched peer-to-peer with another trade, you get a better price than anyone else can get on-chain.

Users can trade their deposited assets, across all currencies supported in the Aave Protocol, even when they are being used as collateral.</p>\n<p>Flash Loans were the first undercollateralised loan option to shake up the DeFi space, resulting in the creation of many innovative tools and “money legos”. Flash Loans continued to inspire ideas to make new features possible in Aave V2.</p>\n<p>Before V2, if a user wanted to use part of their collateral to repay a loan, they had to first withdraw the collateral, use it to buy the borrowed asset, and then finally repay the debt and unlock the deposited collateral. This new feature allows users to close their loan positions by paying directly with their collateral in just 1 transaction — smooth and simple.</p>\n<p>Previously, a liquidator needed to have capital in their own wallet or source it from somewhere else in order to liquidate a position and get that liquidation bonus. With Aave V2, liquidators can utilise Flash Loans to flash borrow the capital from the Aave Protocol itself in order to execute a liquidation.</p>\n<p>And much more!

        "fullDescription": "<p>Formed by three friends at the beginning of the COVID era in Jan 2020, RTFKT was born on the metaverse, and this has defined its feel to this day. RTFKT is a very eclectic, creator led organisation. RTFKT uses the latest in game engines, NFT , blockchain authentication and augmented reality, combined with manufacturing expertise to create one of a kind sneakers and digital artifacts. RTFKT is known to be creating viral sneaker designs, memes and collectible exclusives. RTFKT has maintained a reputation of being more than a little ahead of the cutting edge of technology, a rep that has many mystified, as they would appear to lack the resources and manpower to rival giants in terms of research and development in the birth of digital fashion. Rumours around a rogue AI (stolen from the Space X) used by RTFKT to create next generation designs are completely false and denied by RTFKT. There has been absolutely no evidence or legal action to justify these rumours. For many years, RTFKT was an undefined collective, working strictly in the shadows, providing designs and concepts to game companies and a few select fashion brands, in 2020 they formed an entity to expand their services into the public metamarket. The response has been excellent, and RTFKT’s social growth has been almost frightening. The RTFKT project was scheduled to take off in 2040, but the human development in consciousness has accelerated faster than anticipated. We are here to accelerate our digital future now.</p>",

You can claim one random Club Dog for each Bored Ape you own. Once a dog has been claimed by a Bored Ape, that token cannot be used to claim another canine again.</p>\n<p>At the time of minting, the dogs will be unrevealed. After one week, at 6pm EST on June 25th, the adoption drive will come to a close. A randomized starting index will be set, and everyone will be able to meet their companion.</p>\n<p>The unclaimed dogs? They'll be released into the swamp, never to be seen again.</p>\n<p>The BAKC collection will have a 2.5% royalty fee associated with secondary sales on OpenSea. All proceeds we generate from this fee will be donated to charity. We're looking at several no-kill animal shelters to donate to, and intend to donate via The Giving Block. The first donation would be to Wright-Way Rescue. After six weeks, we'll remove the 2.5% fee from OpenSea entirely.</p>\n<p>Let's rescue some pooches, apes.</p>\n<p>There are 10,000 total Bored Ape Kennel Club NFTs. Each BAKC dog is stored as an ERC-721 token on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS. Every dog in the kennel club is unique and programmatically-generated from over 170 possible traits. Some traits are rarer than others.</p>",

Users can trade their deposited assets, across all currencies supported in the Aave Protocol, even when they are being used as collateral.</p>\n<p>Flash Loans were the first undercollateralised loan option to shake up the DeFi space, resulting in the creation of many innovative tools and “money legos”. Flash Loans continued to inspire ideas to make new features possible in Aave V2.</p>\n<p>Before V2, if a user wanted to use part of their collateral to repay a loan, they had to first withdraw the collateral, use it to buy the borrowed asset, and then finally repay the debt and unlock the deposited collateral. This new feature allows users to close their loan positions by paying directly with their collateral in just 1 transaction — smooth and simple.</p>\n<p>Previously, a liquidator needed to have capital in their own wallet or source it from somewhere else in order to liquidate a position and get that liquidation bonus.

        "fullDescription": "<p>League of Kingdoms is a free-to-play, MMO war strategy game on the blockchain. The main gameplay of League of Kingdoms is similar to a traditional RTS (Real-time strategy), but it is powered by blockchain technology and ownership is central to the core concepts of the game. As an alliance-based tactical strategy game, players can build kingdoms, raise armies, form alliances, and compete on the battlefields. All the lands in the game are non-fungible tokens and can be owned by users.</p>\n<p>Players do not require any prior experience or knowledge with cryptocurrencies to play the game and do not need to own Land NFTs to farm resources that can be tokenized into NFTs. With the adoption of the LOKA token, League of Kingdoms is enjoying greater player adoption, inclusion, and activation as players can effectively own, propose, vote and earn on the game platform.</p>\n<p>LOKA is League of Kingdoms' native governance token and will be utilized as the currency inside the League of Kingdoms game franchise and will be utilized for all in-game store purchases, such as purchasing packages, skins, goods. The $LOKA token will be used as an NFT booster to create, upgrade, and acquire special NFT assets, including but not limited to upcoming Drago and Skin NFTs. The LOKA token will be also used to propose and vote on on-chain governance proposals to determine future features, policies, content, and/or parameters of the game. Last but not least LOKA tokens can also be earned by playing the in-game competition and/or achieving special tasks — for example after each Continent vs. Continent (CvC) battle, winners will be rewarded with LOKA tokens (and potentially rarer NFT item rewards!) depending on the performance during the battle.</p>",

With the perfect combination of fighting and strategy, this game becomes thrillingly immersive and is split up into separate three-minute games.</p>\n<p>Players can combine the cards in their own card library in different ways to ensure that their deck is as strong as possible. They can play either PVE or PVP by deploying and placing cards. Different cards have different effects, and whether we’re talking about Common or Legendary cards, players will be keen to collect them all. Players will be tasked not only to watch their own deck but also to carefully observe the movements and positioning of their opponents. This provides the player with an incentive to practice and develop their in-game skills over time while receiving fantastic brain training akin to that received by chess players. Only, this training is manifested in skilfully using heroes to ride thousands out to the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Of course, in addition to the game being fun, each one of the player’s cards has its own value. Players can obtain high-value cards by collecting, fighting, trading, summoning or synthesizing certain cards. This is also one of the biggest charms of GameFi when compared with traditional games. Era7 will continuously update the game’s content, adding new cards, playing methods and battle passes to meet the continuous needs of players while generating revenue across the board. Early players of Era7 will enjoy dividends from the ecosystem. We have a reward mechanism in place for inviting friends and sharing the game. Era7 provides a whole host of profit models for individuals and organizations from a variety of backgrounds and vertical markets.</p>",

It also includes integrations with all major aggregators and DEXs, as well as proprietary integrations with professional liquidity providers and market makers. These proprietary liquidity sources account for over 30% of daily crypto trading volume.</p>\n<p>Between the liquidity and the underlying tech, Native gives teams a significant advantage over legacy standalone DEXs, and it’s completely free to use.</p>\n<p>Shopify empowered millions of entrepreneurs to create their own eCommerce sites, cutting out middle-men, reducing costs, and boosting revenue. Native does the same for crypto entrepreneurs. The tech is completely modular, so teams can create whatever type of exchange they want, using whatever liquidity sources, pricing models, and trading pairs they want.</p>\n<p>Liquidity comes from one of three sources:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The project itself</li>\n  <li>The community (public pools)</li>\n  <li>Outside liquidity sources (AMMs, Aggregators, Market makers, or professional liquidity providers)</li>\n</ol>",

        "fullDescription": "<p>In <strong>Ultimate Champions</strong>, we crafted an innovative experience where players can leverage their <strong>football knowledge </strong>to build the <strong>best possible team every week</strong> in order to earn rewards that hold long-term value in our <strong>open economy: </strong>Cards (NFTs) and Tokens (MGC/$CHAMP).</p>\n<p>We have always been passionate about video games and we love crafting a polished player experience.</p>\n<p>For the past 7 years we witnessed and studied the rise of blockchain technology and Web3 while developing video games at Ubisoft.</p>\n<p>In video games with traditional frameworks, players <strong>don't truly own their in-game assets. </strong>Game items have <strong>no value outside of the game </strong>and when a player stops playing a particular game, all the time and money invested in that game is lost forever. The game items are stuck in the game's ecosystem forever.</p>\n<p>By leveraging the capabilities of blockchain and NFTs, we can solve these problems and give players <strong>true ownership</strong> <strong>over the assets</strong> they earn or purchase in the game. Game items are NFTs and therefore have value in cryptocurrency, inside and outside of the game.</p>\n<p>The next generation of games is play-to-earn!</p>\n<p>We want to build a <strong>fantasy sports platform</strong> for a <strong>mainstream audience </strong>and leverage our free-to-play expertise to make a <strong>fun game</strong>, that is very accessible and easy to onboard on. Our ambition is to bring play-to-earn games to the masses.</p>\n<p>We plan to focus on <strong>football</strong> first and build an accessible <strong>cross-league</strong> fantasy football game.</p>\n<p>Once we're done building a fantasy football game we are proud of, we will expand our eco-system with additional fantasy sports.</p>",

Radiant itself has been fully audited by Solidity Finance with a second audit near completion by Peckshield.</p>\n<p>Radiant v2 will allow for full cross-chain borrowing/lending on BTC, ETH and USDC, followed by the gradual rollout of additional assets voted on by the Radiant DAO.</p>\n<p>Welcome to an omnichain future.</p>",

It is the biggest exchange of the BNB Chain ecosystem and one of the top community DEXs by the baby doge community. The exchange employs an automated market maker (AMM) model, allowing users to swap against a liquidity pool. You can become a liquidity provider and receive LP tokens, which entitle users to a share of the swap fees.</p>\n<p>LP token holders can also engage in yield farming to earn BabyDoge, the swap's utility token. The token can be staked in so-called ‘Farms’ or Pools with flexible or fixed-term staking. When the BabyDoge token is held in your wallet users receive lower swap fees.</p>\n<p>BabyDogeSwap Supported Coins List All BEP-20 tokens can be traded, such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, and all other big layer-one blockchains.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.30% trading fee, with 0.20% returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward, 0.05% sent to the treasury and 0.05% sent towards a buyback and burn program. However some pairs such as BabyDoge/BNB and other requested pairs have a 0% Swap fee. In addition when holding the BabyDoge token users receive up to 70% OFF per swap giving as low as 0.09% swap fees. Perhaps the lowest swap fees in all of defi !</p>",

Our app <strong>challenges</strong> this standard — now <strong>everyone can earn </strong>by doing simple tasks they <strong>love doing anyway</strong>!</p>\n<p>IguVerse is even more than just activities on social media. We prioritize our <strong>socialize-to-earn </strong>mode, where users complete tasks on social networks to get rewards but also include <strong>move-to-earn </strong>and <strong>play-to-earn</strong> mechanics that make your gaming experience more <strong>diverse</strong>. While move-to-earn motivates users to lead a healthy lifestyle by <strong>walking </strong>their real or virtual pet, play-to-earn lets them have fun in <strong>a classic arcade game</strong>. In addition to this wide variety of mechanics, we provide access to <strong>an integrated DEX</strong> (decentralized exchange) and <strong>a marketplace</strong>, where users can trade their coins and NFTs.</p>\n<p>To enter our game, you need to adopt <strong>a virtual pet </strong>— an NFT pet you can create with <strong>your own design</strong> in mind!

        "fullDescription": "<p>Thales is an Ethereum protocol currently deployed on Optimism that allows the creation of peer-to-peer parimutuel markets. A parimutuel market is a market where collateral is placed in a single shared pool and the final payout to the winning participants is not determined until a market-settling event has occurred. &nbsp;This can be the result of two opposing outcomes (for example picking if the price of an asset will be above or below a strike price on a certain date), or it can be decided by any number of pre-defined possibilities. From the French term \"pari mutuel\" meaning \"mutual betting\", &nbsp;the payoff for these types of markets can be easily understood as the total pool (minus the house fee) shared across all winning positions. Thales protocol is the building block of novel on-chain initiatives: A platform for AMM-based positional markets (two outcomes), an exotic markets platform, and a survival winner(s)-take-all positioning on-chain game played in rounds called Thales Royale. The set of smart contracts composing Thales leverages uncensorable sUSD as collateral, an immutable source of truth for market settlement from Chainlink data feeds, and all the advantages (speed, costs, and security) of a rollup-centric network like Optimism. ThalesDAO, as a collective, is the owner of the protocol and it conducts governance through the Thales Council, elected by THALES token holders. With the support of bright minds, talented souls, and passionate people from the Thales community the protocol gets iterated, battle-tested, and more resilient every day. We are on our way to becoming unstoppable.</p>",

The application has an Automated<strong> </strong>interface for everyone and a whitelisted<strong> </strong>Enterprise<strong> </strong>interface for organizations like DAOs, treasuries, and protocols.</p>\n<p>Gamma's key feature is the<strong> </strong>Vault.<strong> </strong>A vault is a non-custodial position manager contract that can manage a liquidity pool with<strong> </strong>Strategies.<strong> </strong>These vaults create tokens for the user that can be used for internal and external Incentive<strong> </strong>Programs.</p>\n<p>Gamma's vaults are built on the Uniswap V3 and Quickswap V3<strong> </strong>liquidity platforms. Gamma's vaults are compatible with various networks on those platforms.</p>\n<p>The GAMMA token, while staked, allows stakers to earn fees by collecting a portion of generated fees from all Gamma pools. The percentage of fees varies from pool to pool.</p>",

Behind this project stands a highly qualified team with a strong background in crypto. XDAO was successfully launched on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, HECO and is going to further expand into more blockchains. The main idea of XDAO is to allow people to create a decentralized autonomous organization of any size. XDAO is working on delivering a product that reveals the full potential of a company on a blockchain by providing it with all the tools they need for successful operations. For more savvy users XDAO can also be described as an off‐chain voting mechanism with on‐chain execution. The XDAO team are winners of the BSC Hackathon, HECO Hackathon and have received a grant from Polygon over the summer of 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes XDAO different from other DAO builders:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Modular Structure (everything you want to have in your DAO can be implemented through modules: Snapshot Integration, Timelock controller, voice delegation, etc.).</li>\n  <li>Hybrid voting (Cheaper and faster voting).</li>\n  <li>Direct Interaction with DeFi through Wallet Connect.</li>\n  <li>&nbsp;DAO ecosystem where investors can come in, analyze, and invest in the most perspective projects.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What can be done with XDAO:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>DeFi project treasury team management.</li>\n  <li>Salary treasury/marketing treasury for any blockchain organization.</li>\n  <li>Grant program/bug bounty&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Investing in DeFi with mutual&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Investing in NFT and&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Charity.</li>\n  <li>Joint participation in any Allocations, IDOs or Launchpads.</li>\n  <li>Family treasury management and many other use cases.</li>\n</ul>",

Our platform allows users to trade and exchange assets in a fast, secure, and cost-effective way.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of Swapsicle is our native token, POPs, which serves as a proof of participation utility token. POPs is a unique and innovative token that offers a range of benefits for holders and users of Swapsicle.</p>\n<p>As a speculative commodity, POPs has value as an asset that can be traded on the open market. Investors can purchase POPs with the expectation of seeing appreciation in value over time. However, POPs also acts as a membership that gives users access to exclusive features and benefits on the Swapsicle platform.</p>\n<p>Holding POPs allows users to earn transaction fee rewards, enter into staking mechanisms such as Icebox and Icevault, and access other lucrative opportunities. These mechanisms allow users to earn higher returns on their assets simply by holding POPs.</p>\n<p>In this way, POPs is similar to a membership at a store like Costco, where holding the membership gives you access to discounted products and other perks. However, POPs differs from a traditional membership in that it can be sold on the open market to other investors, providing a potentially lucrative opportunity for entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Overall, the POPs token is an integral part of the Swapsicle ecosystem, offering a range of benefits for holders and users of the platform. By purchasing and holding POPs, investors can access exclusive features and opportunities, as well as potentially see appreciation in value over time. We believe that POPs is a unique and innovative token that has the potential to drive significant growth and success for Swapsicle and its users.</p>",

        "fullDescription": "<p>Holdr is a Balancer Friendly Fork on the Aurora Chain. It's a multi-token automated market maker (AMM) that functions as a self-balancing weighted portfolio protocol. It allows anyone to create or add liquidity to customizable pools and earn trading fees.</p>\n<p>It mimics the concept of an index fund where assets are regularly being reallocated based on the price and returns of the assets. Index fund is a common financial instrument that helps investors to achieve risk diversification by maintaining a controlled risk exposure to a portfolio. Rather than paying a portfolio manager to actively or programmatically manage users' funds, Holdr helps solve a similar problem with smart contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Weighted Pools</strong></p>\n<p>Weighted Pools are highly versatile and configurable pools. They are ideal for general cases and enable users to build pools with different token counts and weightings, such as pools with 80/20 or 60/20/20 weightings.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Stable Pools</strong></p>\n<p>For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics) a more efficient design is the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Boosted Pools</strong></p>\n<p>Boosted Pools will bring the best of both worlds to Liquidity Providers and Swappers. Swappers get access to deep stablecoin liquidity with near-parity exchange rates while Liquidity Providers get their liquidity positions sent to external protocols, such as Bastion.</p>",

        "fullDescription": "Overview\n<p>Australis is a decentralized non-custodial lending service on Aurora. Aurora is a smart contract on the NEAR Protocol. Users can participate as depositors or borrowers: the former adds liquidity and earn a passive income, latter is able to borrow from an overcollateralized liquidity protocol. Australis is completely open source, meaning anyone can interact with a user interface client, API or directly with the smart contracts on the Aurora network. At Australis, we’re working to build easy-to-use dev tools to enable everyone to build any third-party service or Dapps on our platform. Finally, the roadmap will be announced publicly soon.</p>\nInteraction with Australis\n<p>From the available list of assets, you can deposit your preferred ones to use as collateral on the app, whatever amount you like. After depositing, you will earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. By depositing an asset you’re allowed to borrow a different asset by using your deposit as collateral. Any interest you earn by depositing funds helps offset the interest rate you accumulate by borrowing. Interacting with Australis requires transactions and subsequently transaction fees for Aurora Network usage, calculated by a mix of network status and transaction complexity. It’s worth stressing the fact that Aurora’s fees are calculated and paid in ETH and it’s considerably lower than other networks such as Ethereum itself.</p>\nStorage of Funds\n<p>Your funds are allocated in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public and open source. The funds could be withdrawn on-demand or exported as a token (astToken) version of your lender position. astToken just like any other token could be moved and traded on the Aurora network.</p>",

Especially in East Asia market, more improvements would be made to lower the learning barrier for users. With the gradual improvement of the protocol, WePiggy may build up a series of dApps for users here.</p>\n<p>In WePiggy’s governance, the core team would like to take a more positive and responsible role. We believe in the importance of goals and fundamental principles, and we fully understand that high quality governance won’t happen in a soulless project.</p>\n<p>Therefore, at the early stage of WePiggy’s governance, the core team will actively participate in the governance to work with the community to form an atmosphere of scientific governance. We will discuss the basic governance framework of WePiggy Protocol with all members of the community in our first proposal after the governance forum goes live</p>",

Those data will be used to change the collected fees amount, where fees are redistributed based on time.</p>\n<p>As result, similar NFTs can generate more fees, than total liquidity provided and can be a subject to re-sell expensive in future on <u>https://app.openbisea.com</u></p>\n<p>In general, we are using 20% from regular fees to redistribute. Amount for redistribution weights used follow that formula:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>80% redistributed based on initial liquidity compare with current liquidity</li>\n  <li>20% redistributed based on position creation time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let say, then Alice, Bob, Eve invest the same liquidity in the pool, but at a different time according to a list position. In that case Alice will increase 20% * 20% = 4% from total rewards Bob will have the same, Eve will have decreased 4% from total rewards.</p>\n<p>But, if Bob will have initial liquidity higher than others, he will be compensated and receive more than Alice and Eve.

We will enable institutional investors to participate in a growing DeFi sector through these needed sets of tools. &nbsp;&nbsp;*PureFi doesn’t break the decentralization principle. Instead, we focus on maintaining the anonymity of users. *DeFi projects (DEXs, liquidity pool operators, IDO platforms) are enabled to filter all incoming transactions with illicit or high-risk assets and evaluate risk score interacting with each wallet. With the same principle, AAVE already launched an institutional liquidity pool with KYC and AML, showing the trend for such services and institutional needs. *Users are incentivized to use PureFi to protect themselves ahead of future regulation. &nbsp;*Relationships with several AML and KYC providers who, ahead of time, signed up to provide services and analytics for our users when the protocol is launched. &nbsp;*Technical and strategic partnerships with Hacken, Arcadia Group, and Casper Labs. *Protocol architecture is designed to direct user interaction with 3rd party providers off-chain to maintain low transaction costs. *Massive interest from TradFi entities (traditional hedge funds, banks) to become customers and users of the platform, highlighting and validating the need for such service. *No toxic investments approach (no-flippers)</p>",

However, unlike Uniswap, those SUSHI tokens will also entitle you to continue to earn a portion of the protocol’s fee, accumulated in SUSHI, even if you decide to no longer participate in the liquidity provision.</p>\n<p>The earnings that you’ll receive from staking will be proportional to the amount of LP tokens you have staked versus the total amount of LP tokens staked. Unless you continue to provide liquidity, your holdings and corresponding reward earnings will gradually be diluted.</p>\n<p>In SushiSwap, 0.25% go directly to the active liquidity providers, while the remaining 0.05% get converted back to SUSHI (obviously through SushiSwap) and distributed to the SUSHI token holders ?.</p>",

Our platform allows users to trade and exchange assets in a fast, secure, and cost-effective way.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of Swapsicle is our native token, POPs, which serves as a proof of participation utility token. POPs is a unique and innovative token that offers a range of benefits for holders and users of Swapsicle.</p>\n<p>As a speculative commodity, POPs has value as an asset that can be traded on the open market. Investors can purchase POPs with the expectation of seeing appreciation in value over time. However, POPs also acts as a membership that gives users access to exclusive features and benefits on the Swapsicle platform.</p>\n<p>Holding POPs allows users to earn transaction fee rewards, enter into staking mechanisms such as Icebox and Icevault, and access other lucrative opportunities. These mechanisms allow users to earn higher returns on their assets simply by holding POPs.</p>\n<p>In this way, POPs is similar to a membership at a store like Costco, where holding the membership gives you access to discounted products and other perks. However, POPs differs from a traditional membership in that it can be sold on the open market to other investors, providing a potentially lucrative opportunity for entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Overall, the POPs token is an integral part of the Swapsicle ecosystem, offering a range of benefits for holders and users of the platform. By purchasing and holding POPs, investors can access exclusive features and opportunities, as well as potentially see appreciation in value over time. We believe that POPs is a unique and innovative token that has the potential to drive significant growth and success for Swapsicle and its users.</p>",

Users can trade their deposited assets, across all currencies supported in the Aave Protocol, even when they are being used as collateral.</p>\n<p>Flash Loans were the first undercollateralised loan option to shake up the DeFi space, resulting in the creation of many innovative tools and “money legos”. Flash Loans continued to inspire ideas to make new features possible in Aave V2.</p>\n<p>Before V2, if a user wanted to use part of their collateral to repay a loan, they had to first withdraw the collateral, use it to buy the borrowed asset, and then finally repay the debt and unlock the deposited collateral. This new feature allows users to close their loan positions by paying directly with their collateral in just 1 transaction — smooth and simple.</p>\n<p>Previously, a liquidator needed to have capital in their own wallet or source it from somewhere else in order to liquidate a position and get that liquidation bonus. With Aave V2, liquidators can utilise Flash Loans to flash borrow the capital from the Aave Protocol itself in order to execute a liquidation.</p>\n<p>And much more!

Images of Avaxtars are saved on IPFS and their existence is recorded on Avalanche Mainnet as unique ERC-721 Tokens. To create an Avaxtar we are using a digital genetic code (DGC) and we create a hash value of these genes, so we guarantee that all Avaxtars are different from each other.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO WITH MY AVAXTARS?</strong></p>\n<p>Creating an Avaxtar is just a beginning of a great adventure. If you like your Avaxtar you can keep it as long as you want to be bounded as an ERC-721 Token to your Metamask wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>Avaxtars Roadmap</strong></p>\n<p>Phase 1 started on March 31, 2021, at 18:00</p>\n<p>Everyone can generate new Avaxtars by covering their costs. Those Avaxtars are Generation 1 (<strong>Gen1</strong>) and the maximum amount of <strong>Gen1 Avaxtars</strong> that can be generated is <strong>10.000</strong>.</p>\n<p>Phase 2 started on June 14, 2021, at 18:00 with an AirDrop.</p>\n<p>Players are able to purchase a “<strong>Personal Avaxtar Generation Machine (PAGM)</strong>” with <strong>$AVXT Tokens</strong>. <strong>PAGM</strong> device can generate new <strong>Gen2 Avaxtars</strong> and players can farm <strong>$AVXT</strong>.</p>\n<p>In Phase 3, all Avaxtars can go to missions, gain experience, and reach new levels.</p>",

Users will then be able to use the YUSD to purchase additional assets, hedge their position, or provide liquidity for additional rewards.</p>\n<p>At any time, 1 YUSD can be redeemed for $1 of underlying collateral. Yeti Finance builds off Liquity's economic model to ensure peg stability and efficient liquidations.</p>\n<p>Yeti Finance also offers cross-margining, something the majority of borrowing protocols don't have. In simple terms, users on Yeti Finance can open up a borrowing position on their entire portfolio instead of just a single asset.</p>\n<p>Cross-margining makes borrowing against volatile assets much safer as multiple assets can serve as collateral for your loan instead of just one, greatly reducing the risk of liquidations due to asset volatility and flash crashes.</p>\n<p>Yeti Finance is a<strong> quantum leap</strong> forward in the stablecoin/lending landscape.</p>",

You can also win tokens in a random manner.</p>\n<p>Anyone with 500 or more FRB tokens in their wallet can start a freebie!</p>\n<p>You need to keep an eye on the vault, and when there are more than 1200 FRB tokens, you need to start the “/startfreebie” command. And then claim your FRB tokens!</p>\n<p>You can also win 100 FRB tokens completely randomly if you have 500 or more FRB tokens in your wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> All FRB token transactions are subject to a fee of 5%. If you buy, sell or send FRB tokens from wallet to wallet, then a fee of 5% will be charged. And this fee from all these transactions is accumulated in the vault.</p>\n<p>When more than 1200 FRB tokens accumulate in the vault, you can start a freebie.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens when Freebie starts up? </strong>1200 FRB tokens are withdrawn from the vault and sent to the freebie balance and marketing wallet. 1000 FRB tokens are sent to the freebie balance and 200 FRB tokens to the marketing wallet.</p>\n<p>These 1000 FRB tokens are distributed equally among 10 users. The first user to launch the current freebie (freebie activator) wins 100 FRB tokens. The remaining 9 users are randomly selected from all FRB token holders who have 500 or more FRB tokens on their balance, and they win 100 FRB tokens each. These 9 lucky winners have 24 hours from the launch of the current freebie to claim their tokens. You need to run the “/claimfreebie” command to claim your tokens. If the winners didn’t claim the tokens, then those tokens that the winners didn’t claim in the current freebie will automatically be sent to the person who launched the current freebie (freebie activator).</p>",

        "fullDescription": "<p>Build a 1-click experience: enable users to interact with any asset, any application, from any chain.</p>\n<p>Axelar goes far beyond sending wrapped assets with General Message Passing, which carries any payload securely cross-chain. Applications can call any function on any connected chain, and deliver a one-click experience for users on any other connected chain. This is a new kind of dApp development that puts users first and lets developers build on the platform best suited to their use case.</p>\n<p>Cross-chain communication is easy. Secure cross-chain communication is hard. Most solutions today are permissioned multisigs, based on proof-of-authority, which has lost hundreds of millions in security exploits. Axelar network security is based on delegated proof-of-stake: a permissionless, dynamic validator set applies a consensus approach that is similar to the networks Axelar connects.</p>\n<p>Atop of the Axelar stack sits an application-development layer, used to compose across any number of chains. Developers go cross-chain without new programming languages or added complexity. They focus on building the functionality that differentiates their dApp.</p>",

        "fullDescription": "<p>YetiSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) which runs on Avalanche, uses thesame automated market-making (AMM) model as Uniswap, features a native governance token called YTS that is fully community distributed and is capable of trading all tokens issued on Ethereum and Avalanche. In a crowded marketplace with multiple contenders, YetiSwap offers three critically important benefits: fast and cheap trades, and a fair and open token distribution. First, YetiSwap can finalize trades quickly and cheaply. Since YetiSwap is built on Avalanche, it enables users to swap assets while enjoying sub-second transaction finality and transaction fees as low as a few cents. Oftentimes, trades on YetiSwap will feel as fast as trades on centralized exchanges. Second, beyond the significant performance upgrades to the technical status quo. Users of existing AMMs, such as Pangolin, Uniswap and Sushiswap, are already familiar with their mechanism of action. Therefore, the rest of this post does not discuss how YetiSwap achieves its trading capabilities. Instead, we discuss the YTS token in more detail, including its distribution mechanism and governance rules.</p>",

        "fullDescription": "<p><strong>Why Equalizer - Let Us Enlighten You</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Equalizer was derived from the initial concept of Andre Cronje. The mechanism that was used to create a perpetual decentralized exchange was unique and ingenious. The launch of this platform is to take the concept and apply it to a more natural style DEX. Equalizer will become the trading mechanism for the Fantom network, utilizing the Solidly perpetual model with some tweaks to fee structures and emissions.</li>\n  <li>The perpetual model is the first of its kind that can sustain an emission token price. The problem that is tackled here, is to create an equalized effect across the rewards for token holders and the incentive for LP providers.</li>\n  <li>Our model supports this as it rewards liquidity with a valuable token, that devices an income similar to the Curve model. The fee structure ensures that the utility and reward for holding and locking the token is high enough to support the required liquidity to succeed in low slippage trades.</li>\n  <li>Charging a low fee (E.g. 0.01%) is a flawed concept, unless the volume warrants the incentive required to hold enough TVL, especially for volatile pairs. This in turn, creates a spiral in the native token price destroying the platforms' ability to maintain liquidity.</li>\n  <li>Now, who really cares about a fee of 0.01% if the slippage in the trade is 2% or 3%. Hopefully now you are starting to see the necessity of maintaining a fee that supports low slippage trades. This in turn provides a better result and experience for the trader.</li>\n</ul>",

It is a community-driven project that distributes and rewards FANTOM between community members, subject to certain conditions.Holders of FIZO will receive passive rewards from simply holding the token in their wallet, as every transaction such as buy, sell, has a Swapping charge of 11%,and 11% respectively which is distributed evenly to all existing fizo token holders according to their FIZO volume in the wallet. For every transaction, a portion is set aside for marketing, the liquidity pool, and a rewards pool for all holders. As a result, FIZO aims to promote a ‘hold and earn’ culture, which reduces selling pressure.</p>\n<p>The FIZO price is calculated in the principle of 10s. At the time of its launch, its initial price was 0.0001. When a buyer bought it for 100000 Fantom, the FIZO value raised to 0.001 which means that One zero burned when a 1000000 Fantom entered the system. In order to kill the next zero, another 10000000 Fantom needs to be entered to increase</p>\n<p>the price of FIZO up to 0.01. This is how the price coding works. To achieve 1 FIZO = 1 FANTOM, the system must have 10,0000,000 FANTOM.</p>\n<p>No one can change or edit any data or transactions. The owner also can't withdraw the balance from Smart Contract, even they can't edit anything too. Only users can withdraw</p>",

Not only do they provide users the ability to “hodl” or leverage their crypto assets, obtaining liquidity from their investment (a crypto-backed loan) while simultaneously earning interest, they also underpin the workings of other protocols. The movement of assets from the Ethereum mainnet to EVM-compatible blockchains and scaling solutions has done nothing to alter this. Platforms that grant the ability to borrow and lend are one of the key applications users look for in any emerging chain. Hundred Finance aims to play a central role in provisioning these services in the multi-chain environment that has flourished since early 2021, delivering the freedom to earn yield and borrow assets to a growing number of users in a trustless, secure, and economically efficient manner.</p>",

Once miners are hired they work for you indefinitely, providing you with an unlimited amount of FANTOM at a starting rate of 3% daily. Strategies are personal, you either strictly compound AKA \"Hire More Miners\", strictly pocket FANTOM or you do a healthy combination of both.

Our platform allows users to trade and exchange assets in a fast, secure, and cost-effective way.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of Swapsicle is our native token, POPs, which serves as a proof of participation utility token. POPs is a unique and innovative token that offers a range of benefits for holders and users of Swapsicle.</p>\n<p>As a speculative commodity, POPs has value as an asset that can be traded on the open market. Investors can purchase POPs with the expectation of seeing appreciation in value over time. However, POPs also acts as a membership that gives users access to exclusive features and benefits on the Swapsicle platform.</p>\n<p>Holding POPs allows users to earn transaction fee rewards, enter into staking mechanisms such as Icebox and Icevault, and access other lucrative opportunities. These mechanisms allow users to earn higher returns on their assets simply by holding POPs.</p>\n<p>In this way, POPs is similar to a membership at a store like Costco, where holding the membership gives you access to discounted products and other perks. However, POPs differs from a traditional membership in that it can be sold on the open market to other investors, providing a potentially lucrative opportunity for entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Overall, the POPs token is an integral part of the Swapsicle ecosystem, offering a range of benefits for holders and users of the platform.
